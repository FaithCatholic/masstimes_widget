# MassTimes_Widget

A custom Drupal module embedding a full-screen interactive map and sidebar list of Catholic parishes, powered by the MassTimes Trust database & API.

## 🚀 Features

- **Auto-detect** your current location via browser geolocation  
- **Fallback** to configurable default latitude/longitude if geolocation is unavailable or denied  
- **Search** by ZIP code or City, State (US-only autocomplete via Nominatim)  
- **Interactive map** (Leaflet) with parish markers & popups  
- **Scrollable sidebar** of parish details, synchronized with map clicks  
- **Mobile-friendly** responsive layout  

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. In the Block layout screen, place the **MassTimes Map Fullscreen Block**.  
2. Under **Default latitude** and **Default longitude**, enter your preferred fallback coordinates.  
   If the user declines geolocation or no URL query parameters are present, the map will center on these values.

3. When viewing the page, the map will render full-width with the sidebar alongside:

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone or download into `web/modules/custom/mass_times_widget`.  
2. Ensure dependencies in `mass_times_widget.info.yml` are met (e.g. `leaflet` module).  
3. Run `drush en mass_times_widget -y` (or enable via the UI).  
4. Clear caches: `drush cr`.

## 🧩 How It Works

- **Block plugin** (`MassTimesMapBlock`) fetches user coordinates from URL (`?lat=…&long=…`) or falls back to the values configured on the block.  
- It calls the MassTimes API (`https://apiv4.updateparishdata.org/Churchs/`) to retrieve nearby churches, sorts them by distance, and builds a GeoJSON feature collection.  
- The Twig template (`masstimes-map.html.twig`) renders the map container and sidebar.  
- The accompanying JS behavior initializes the Leaflet map, adds parish markers, and ties marker clicks to opening the corresponding `<details>` in the sidebar.  
- The module ships with CSS to ensure a full-width layout, responsive sidebar, and styled parish cards.

- **Peter Wagner & the MassTimes Trust** ([masstimes.org](https://masstimes.org/)) for their comprehensive global database of Catholic parishes and worship times.  
- **Leaflet** for interactive maps.  
- **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)** for address/ZIP autocomplete.
